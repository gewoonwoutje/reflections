How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 It is a place where files are added from the working directory so that they can commit all at once to the repository.
 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 using git diff [no argument], git diff --staged, and git status
 
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
 When it is particularly usefull to have 2 'current' versions, which might merge later. Branches help by keeping the old version 'working'.
