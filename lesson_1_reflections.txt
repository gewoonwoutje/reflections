How did viewing a FC between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
 It showed the lines that were changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
 It saves old versions, so when mistakes are made; you can get the old version and check the difference between the old and new

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
 Ultimate control over how much commits there are, but it requires the user to get used to committing versions every once in a while
 
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 Git is designed for programming projects which often contain more than one file, while Google Docs is a text editor for one file per 'project'
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 There always is a backup

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
 Setting up projects
