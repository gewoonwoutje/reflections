When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 To have a backup in the cloud or to cooperate with others in one project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 Some people might make changes that are not wished to have in the local repository (yet).
