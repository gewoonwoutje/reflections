When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 To have a backup in the cloud or to cooperate with others in one project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 Some people might make changes that are not wished to have in the local repository (yet). 
 
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 A fork is special type of a clone (copy) of a github repository to another github repository. A branch is a series of commits in a repository.
 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 It makes it possible to keep track of the commits which enables easy merging of remote and local repositories.
 
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 Manually via dropbox. Saving files in different names which is not easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 For experimental code or to offer an idea to the rest of team which needs being looked at. 
 If it is changed directly in the master branch it won't need pulling pushing merging pulling from/to github.
